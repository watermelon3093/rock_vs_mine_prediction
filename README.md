# rock_vs_mine_prediction
In this project I have used AI/ML to detect if the submarine is above a rock or a mine using the sonar data available.

This is for a small set of data so the accuracy is given below
Training data - 83.422%
Test data - 76.1

This uses 60 readings at once to detect if the object is a rock or a mine.

As you can see at last i have put 60 random reading and the system detected it is a mine and gave a warning message.

The file of the 200 sonar data is also attached.

HOW TO TRY OUT THIS CODE:-
